## 🌱 About Me

Final-year **B.Tech Electrical Engineering** student with a **Minor in Data Science**, actively transitioning into **Software Development and Applied Machine Learning**.

I focus on building **end-to-end, real-world systems** that combine machine learning with clean, usable interfaces. My work emphasizes model generalization, performance, and practical deployment rather than isolated experimentation.

Currently interning at **NIELIT Gorakhpur (MeitY, Government of India)**, where I work on real-time computer vision systems.
